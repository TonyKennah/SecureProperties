# Project Summary

This project is a simple, educational command-line application demonstrating the principles of RSA encryption and decryption using pure Java and `BigInteger`. It includes key generation, OAEP-style padding, and a round-trip demonstration of encrypting and decrypting a user-provided message.

**This implementation is for educational purposes only and should not be used in a production environment.**
